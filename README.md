# About Me
I am a third year Ph.D. Candidate in Physics in the [McWilliams Center for Cosmology](https://www.cmu.edu/cosmology/) at Carnegie Mellon University. 

I work on cosmology using imaging surveys, weak gravitational lensing, and statistical inference. I am a member of the [LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration](https://lsstdesc.org/) focusing on shear estimation and cosmic shear. 

You can see all of my papers on my website [here](https://andyypark.github.io/)
