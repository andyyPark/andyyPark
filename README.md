### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# About Me
I am a fourth year Ph.D. Candidate in Physics in the [McWilliams Center for Cosmology](https://www.cmu.edu/cosmology/) at Carnegie Mellon University. 

This year, I am a DOE SCGSR Fellow working with Matthew Becker at Argonne National Laboratory.

I work on cosmology using imaging surveys, weak gravitational lensing, and statistical inference. I am a member of the [LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration](https://lsstdesc.org/) focusing on shear estimation and cosmic shear.
