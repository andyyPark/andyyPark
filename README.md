# About Me

I am a fourth year Ph.D. Candidate in Physics in the [McWilliams Center for Cosmology](https://www.cmu.edu/cosmology/) at Carnegie Mellon University advised by [Rachel Mandelbaum](https://www.cmu.edu/physics/people/faculty/mandelbaum.html).

This year, I am a [DOE SCGSR](https://science.osti.gov/wdts/scgsr) Fellow working with [Matthew Becker](https://www.anl.gov/profile/matthew-r-becker) at Argonne National Laboratory.

I work on cosmology using imaging surveys, weak gravitational lensing, and statistical inference. I am a member of the [LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration](https://lsstdesc.org/) focusing on shear estimation and cosmic shear.

You can see all of my papers on my website [here](https://andyypark.github.io/)
